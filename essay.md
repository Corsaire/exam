# Toll Roads

There are a lot of problems in our world that have already been somehow solved using centralized systems.Nowadays we have a powerful tool that helps us to have a fresh look at old problems and try to solve them in a decentralized way. So let's dive into the "Toll roads" problem. 

It's been solved as a centralized system that consists of regulated operators with their own centralized and non-transparent systems. As it is supposed to be with every regulated business, regulation is needed to ensure that everyone play by the rules. It's very important part of this business because some abuses from operators can lead to big troubles on the national level. On the other hand, regulators duty is to cause as small overhead to operators business as it's possible. So regulation should not stand in a way of effective evolution of toll roads business.

So, what problems can blockchain solve?

## Transparency

Every operator has its own centralized systems that manage their toll roads. Because of that, it takes a lot of effort for the regulator to control these systems. The regulator needs to set some rules for operators and check their compliance using lots of audit procedures. It can be very hard to make sure that operator does not violate any rules. On the other hand, from a driver perspective, these systems are black boxes. 

We can add transparency by using a decentralized system, built on top of Ethereum. Every payment and its pricing formation will be public and anyone inside the network will have all information about it. It will make regulation easy and every driver will know how the price is made by the transparent algorithm inside the blockchain. You will know who you pay and how the price is formed.

The downside of transparency is lack of privacy for every driver who does not want everyone to be able to track his movement. Even with centralized systems, there are a lot of dissatisfied drivers, who don't like that big companies/government can possibly track their movements. If this system is made on top of public Ethereum network, anyone can track your movements and it's a disaster. There are a few ways how we can solve this issue:

* Make private/consortium blockchain system, so only operators and regulator can see all the information. In order to pay for everything with real Ether, this blockchain can be connected to the main network using Plasma or any inter-blockchain comunication system like Polkadot/Cosmos. That will keep some transparency, the regulator will still have a good control of everything and the operators won't be able to change the rules anytime they want (as they theoretically could in a centralized system). That solution will keep the privacy violation problem on the current level.
* Use some algorithms for anonymizing drivers and vehicles. Or just use other more anonymous blockchains instead of Ethereum. For this problem, anonymizing algorithms should be very good in order to keep privacy, because machine learning can make a lot of miracles nowadays.

## Banking

Currently, all payments go through banks. Operators suffer from lots of bureaucracy and tons of papers that are needed for banks and regulators for every payment. Working through banks can be also very costly. Ethereum allows you to build a system that will make all money transfers through blockchain with no middleman and with small transaction cost.

## Shared payment system

Imagine you travel to a ski resort and every ski lift up there has a different owner with a different payment system. You would have to buy a lot of different ski-passes. It might sound not realistic, but we do have a ski resort like that in Ukraine.
But let's go back to the "toll roads". It could be very painful for drivers/vehicles to pay in different ways to different operators. On the other hand, creating one payment system for different operators can be very problematic too. It comes with all "centralized systems" problems, so operators can not feel safe with it.
I think blockchain system fits perfectly here. With blockchain, we can arrange set of rules, how every payment is split between operators in case if one driver will use multiple toll roads. This solution will also make it easy for a new operator to join. It is much easier because this is open decentralized system and in order to join this system, you only need to register as a new operator in systems regulator.

## Conclusion

Blockchain is a good fit to toll roads problem. It can add necessary transparency and make money transfers cheaper and easier. Moreover, blockchain allows us to create a single secure system for all operators, so drivers won't even bother that they need to pay different operators.
